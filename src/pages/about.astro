					<p>I was born and raised in Pakistan. I spent most of my life in a rural village. Then for my undergrad degree I moved to Hong Kong. I've attached one picture that I took in Pakistan and one that I took in Hong Kong (I'm sure you'll able to tell which one is which ðŸ™‚). Currently I'm studying engineering in HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science & Technology). Feel free to get in touch with me!</p>
