Suppose that you are playing an AAA open-world title, however the game is very cruel and doesn’t let you choose your character. You can’t choose the player’s ethnicity, height nor the gender. The game also assigns you a random spawning point. You feel like it’s quite unfair since you paid $70 for the freaking game. The best example that I can think of off the top my head is GTA V.

The loot in the area is generally much better and the main and the side quests offer better rewards even though they are the same quests that the Pakistani player has to do as well.

The difference in the materialistic worth of both items is roughly about 30 times! However, how can I assure you that the rich boy isn’t 30 times happier than the poor boy, because what mattered is that their parents got them a gift. It’s the emotions behind the gifts that matter not the price tag. Of course, I’m not saying that the gift itself doesn’t matter.

When I was young the most expensive gift that I got from my parents would cost as much as a cricket bat and that was even if I got something. I wanted so many toys and I would dream of them for literal months watching every possible video to get to know how that toy feels. I wanted to have consoles, hoverboards, Beyblades and so much more. It was not just toys, it was the same story for snacks. I remember that whenever I went out shopping with my parents, me and my siblings were very reluctant to buy expensive snacks.
